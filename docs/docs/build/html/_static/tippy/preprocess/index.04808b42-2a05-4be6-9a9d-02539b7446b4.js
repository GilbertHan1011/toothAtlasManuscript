First, we conducted principal component regression to calculate the fraction of variance explained by the covariate of interest within the first 50 principal components. Our analysis revealed that, in some samples, the variance in cell type was considerably greater than the variance across samples. Consequently, it is more appropriate to treat the entire dataset as a single batch rather than treating each of the six samples as separate batches. Conversely, in the CranioSoxc_Angelozzi dataset, sample variance was even greater than cell type variance. Therefore, it is more appropriate to treat each of the six samples as individual batches in this case.</p>", "a[href=\"batch_division.html#conclusion\"]": "<h2 class=\"tippy-header\" style=\"margin-top: 0;\">Conclusion<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#conclusion\" title=\"Permalink to this heading\">#</a></h2><p>By applying these methods, we meticulously evaluated each dataset to effectively minimize technical variation while preserving biological variation.
