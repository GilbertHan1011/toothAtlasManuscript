## Why atlas
One of the most exciting technological innovations in recent years is the rapid development of single-cell technologies, which allow us to examine cells at a remarkable level of detail {cite:p}`lotfollahiFutureRapidAutomated2024`. As a result, numerous well-curated reference atlases have emerged, providing valuable resources for researchersâ€”such as the lung atlas {cite:p}`lakeAtlasHealthyInjured2023`, kidney atlas {cite:p}`sikkemaIntegratedCellAtlas2023`, and the bone atlas {cite:p}`hanTrajectorycentricFrameworkTrajAtlas2024`. But why do we still need these atlases? Here are a few reasons:
- Atlases provide high-resolution annotations that can be transferred to individual studies through reference-mapping algorithms. {cite:p}`lotfollahiFutureRapidAutomated2024`
- They enable comparative analyses between different conditions, such as healthy versus diseased states, yielding valuable biological insights. {cite:p}`sikkemaIntegratedCellAtlas2023`
- Atlases offer a unified framework for trajectory analysis and gene module discovery, facilitating a deeper understanding of cellular dynamics.{cite:p}`hanTrajectorycentricFrameworkTrajAtlas2024`
