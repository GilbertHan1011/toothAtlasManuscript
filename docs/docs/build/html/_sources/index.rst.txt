Welcome to scAtlas's documentation!
===================================

Introduction
------------
ScAtlas is a pipeline for building large-scale single-cell atlases. While there is exponential growth 
in the amount of single-cell data generated, a high quality reference atlas can be valuable resource for 
research groups to derive insights from their data. Here, we hope to provide a pipeline for building 
large-scale single-cell atlases that can be used for a variety of applications.
