# Trajectory Reduction

## Introduction
During development, cells exist in a continuum of states. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data, we can identify these states and reconstruct the differentiation process through trajectory analysis. However, trajectory inference involves several challenges. For example, how do we determine the start and end points? How can we ensure that pseudotime, which measures differentiation progress, accurately reflects the biological process? In this section, we will employ various methods for trajectory visualization to gain insights into cell differentiation during odontogenesis. This unbiased approach will lay the foundation for subsequent trajectory inference analyses.
