Trajectory
===============================
In this section, we focus on odontogenesis and amelogenesis - 
two critical developmental processes in tooth formation. 
Our aim is to explore and understand the dynamic patterns of gene expression 
during these processes. A key question we seek to address is whether there exists a 
universal molecular axis that governs mineralization across different contexts.
