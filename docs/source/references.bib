  abstract = {Cranial neural crest cells are an evolutionary innovation of vertebrates for craniofacial development and function, yet the mechanisms that govern the cell fate decisions of postmigratory cranial neural crest cells remain largely unknown. Using the mouse molar as a model, we perform single-cell transcriptome profiling to interrogate the cell fate diversification of postmigratory cranial neural crest cells. We reveal the landscape of transcriptional heterogeneity and define the specific cellular domains during the progression of cranial neural crest cell-derived dental lineage diversification, and find that each domain makes a specific contribution to distinct molar mesenchymal tissues. Furthermore, IGF signaling-mediated cell-cell interaction between the cellular domains highlights the pivotal role of autonomous regulation of the dental mesenchyme. Importantly, we reveal cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks in the dental mesenchyme and show that Foxp4 is indispensable for the differentiation of periodontal ligament. Our single-cell atlas provides comprehensive mechanistic insight into the cell fate diversification process of the cranial neural crest cell-derived odontogenic populations.},

  abstract = {Osteoblasts are the only cells that can give rise to bones in vertebrates. Thus, one of the most important functions of these metabolically active cells is mineralized matrix production. Because osteoblasts have a limited lifespan, they must be constantly replenished by preosteoblasts, their immediate precursors. Because disruption of the regulation of bone-forming osteoblasts results in a variety of bone diseases, a better understanding of the origin of these cells by defining the mechanisms of bone development, remodeling, and regeneration is central to the development of novel therapeutic approaches. In recent years, substantial new insights into the origin of osteoblasts---largely owing to rapid technological advances in murine lineage-tracing approaches and other single-cell technologies---have been obtained. Collectively, these findings indicate that osteoblasts involved in bone formation under various physiological, pathological, and therapeutic conditions can be obtained from numerous sources. The origins of osteoblasts include, but are not limited to, chondrocytes in the growth plate, stromal cells in the bone marrow, quiescent bone-lining cells on the bone surface, and specialized fibroblasts in the craniofacial structures, such as sutures and periodontal ligaments. Because osteoblasts can be generated from local cellular sources, bones can flexibly respond to regenerative and anabolic cues. However, whether osteoblasts derived from different cellular sources have distinct functions remains to be investigated. Currently, we are at the initial stage to aptly unravel the incredible diversity of the origins of bone-forming osteoblasts. {\copyright} 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).},

However, the division of labor and hierarchical relationship between different progenitor populations remain undetermined. Here we developed dual-recombinase fate-mapping systems to capture the skeletal progenitor transition during postnatal bone formation. We showed that postnatal osteoblasts arose primarily from chondrocytes before adolescence and from Lepr+ bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) after adolescence. This transition occurred in the diaphysis during adolescence and progressively spread to the metaphysis. The osteoblast-forming Lepr+ BMSCs derived primarily from fetal Col2+ cells. Conditional deletion of Runx2 from perinatal chondrocytes and adult Lepr+ BMSCs impaired bone lengthening and thickening, respectively. Forced running increased osteoblast formation by perinatal chondrocytes but not by adult Lepr+ BMSCs. Thus, the short-term developmental skeletal progenitors generated the long-term adult skeletal progenitors. They sequentially control the growth and maintenance of endochondral bones.},

Through in vivo lineage tracing, we demonstrated the power of this approach by showing that co-expression module members Lrig1 and Igfbp5 define populations of incisor epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells. We further discovered that two adjacent mesenchymal tissues, the periodontium and dental pulp, are maintained by distinct pools of stem cells. These findings reveal novel mechanisms of incisor renewal and illustrate how gene co-expression analysis of intact biological systems can provide insights into the transcriptional basis of cellular identity.},

Therefore, we investigated cellular composition of growing and non-growing mouse and human teeth. As a result, we report an unappreciated cellular complexity of the continuously-growing mouse incisor, which suggests a coherent model of cell dynamics enabling unarrested growth. This model relies on spatially-restricted stem, progenitor and differentiated populations in the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments underlying the coordinated expansion of two major branches of pulpal cells and diverse epithelial subtypes. Further comparisons of human and mouse teeth yield both parallelisms and differences in tissue heterogeneity and highlight the specifics behind growing and non-growing modes. Despite being similar at a coarse level, mouse and human teeth reveal molecular differences and species-specific cell subtypes suggesting possible evolutionary divergence. Overall, here we provide an atlas of human and mouse teeth with a focus on growth and differentiation.},

  abstract = {Tooth development is a complex process orchestrated by intricate gene regulatory networks, involving both odontogenic epithelium and ectomesenchyme. Six1, a pivotal transcription factor (TF), is involved in the development of the lower incisor. However, its precise role during incisor development and the molecular mechanisms underpinning its regulatory functions remain poorly understood. This study employs Six1 deletion mouse models to elucidate the critical regulatory role of Six1 in governing dental mesenchyme development. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing, we constructed a comprehensive transcriptome atlas of tooth germ development from the bud to bell stage. Our analyses suggest that the dental follicle and the dental papilla (DP) are differentiated from dental ectomesenchyme (DEM) and identify the key TFs underlying these distinct states. Notably, we show that Dlx1, Dlx2, and Dlx5 (Dlx1/2/5) may function as the key TFs that promote the formation of DP. We further show that the deletion of Six1 perturbs dental mesenchyme development by impeding the transitions from DEM to DP states. Importantly, SIX1 directly binds to the promoters of Dlx1/2/5 to promote their co-expression, which subsequently leads to widespread epigenetic and transcriptional remodeling. In summary, our findings unveil Six1's indispensable role in incisor development, offering key insights into TF-driven regulatory networks that govern dental mesenchyme cell fate transitions during tooth development.},

To date, it has remained elusive whether there are certain differences in the dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) from donors of different ages. In the present study, DPSC lines were derived using teeth from children, adolescents, adults and aged donors. The derivation efficiency, the proliferative and apoptotic rate, cell marker expression and the differentiation capacity were investigated and compared among these DPSC lines. The derivation efficacy was decreased with increasing donor age. Although a large part of cell surface markers was expressed in all DPSC lines, the expression of CD29 was downregulated in the DPSCs from aged teeth. In addition, the doubling time of DPSCs from aged teeth was prolonged and the number of apoptotic cells was increased with the propagation. These DPSCs were able to differentiate into a neuronal linage, which positively expressed the neuron-specific class~III beta-tubulin and microtubule-associated protein~2, as well as into an osteogenic lineage, which positively expressed CD45; however, these DPSCs from aged teeth were completely or partially deprived of differentiation capacity. By contrast, DPSCs from younger teeth displayed significantly higher vitality and a higher potential for use in dental regenerative medicine.},

Mapping new data to the HLCA enables rapid data annotation and interpretation. Using the HLCA as a reference for the study of disease, we identify shared cell states across multiple lung diseases, including SPP1+ profibrotic monocyte-derived macrophages in COVID-19, pulmonary fibrosis and lung carcinoma. Overall, the HLCA serves as an example for the development and use of large-scale, cross-dataset organ atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.},

However, it is not straightforward to compare gene expression levels across datasets and to automatically assign cell type labels in a new dataset based on existing annotations. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that our previously developed method, scVI, provides an effective and fully probabilistic approach for joint representation and analysis of scRNA-seq data, while accounting for uncertainty caused by biological and measurement noise. We also introduce single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI), a semi-supervised variant of scVI designed to leverage existing cell state annotations. We demonstrate that scVI and scANVI compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods for data integration and cell state annotation in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to challenging settings. In contrast to existing methods, scVI and scANVI integrate multiple datasets with a single generative model that can be directly used for downstream tasks, such as differential expression. Both methods are easily accessible through scvi-tools.},

  abstract = {Understanding kidney disease relies on defining the complexity of cell types and states, their associated molecular profiles and interactions within tissue neighbourhoods1. Here we applied multiple single-cell and single-nucleus assays ({$>$}400,000 nuclei~or~cells) and spatial imaging technologies to a broad spectrum of healthy reference kidneys (45 donors) and diseased kidneys (48 patients). This has provided a high-resolution cellular atlas of 51 main cell types, which include rare and previously undescribed cell populations. The multi-omic approach provides detailed transcriptomic profiles, regulatory factors and spatial localizations spanning the entire kidney. We also define 28 cellular states across nephron segments and interstitium that were altered in kidney injury, encompassing cycling, adaptive (successful~or maladaptive repair), transitioning and degenerative states. Molecular signatures permitted the localization of these states within injury neighbourhoods using spatial transcriptomics, while large-scale 3D imaging analysis (around 1.2\,million neighbourhoods) provided corresponding linkages to active immune responses. These analyses defined biological pathways that are relevant to injury time-course and niches, including signatures underlying epithelial repair that predicted maladaptive states associated with a decline in kidney function. This integrated multimodal spatial cell atlas of healthy and diseased human kidneys represents a comprehensive benchmark of cellular states, neighbourhoods, outcome-associated signatures and publicly available interactive visualizations.},

  abstract = {Osteoblast differentiation is crucial for bone formation and maintaining skeletal integrity. Although it is now understood that this process exhibits significant heterogeneity across developmental stages and tissue microenvironments, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we introduce TrajAtlas, a comprehensive framework that addresses this gap in knowledge. TrajAtlas comprises four modules: a reference atlas (Differentiation Atlas), a differentiation model (Differentiation Model), a tool for differential pseudotime analysis (TrajDiff), and a method for pseudotemporal gene module detection (TRAVMap). By leveraging single-cell technologies, TrajAtlas offers a systematic approach to exploring the multi-scale heterogeneity among cells, genes, and gene modules within population-level trajectories across diverse tissues and age groups. We systematically investigate the impact of age and injury on osteogenesis, providing new insights into osteoporosis and bone regeneration. In conclusion, our comprehensive framework offers novel insights into osteogenesis and provides a valuable resource for understanding the complexities of bone formation.Author Summary Osteoblasts, the cells responsible for bone formation, can originate from various cellular sources. However, it's unclear how different progenitor cells differentiate into osteoblasts, and how this process is influenced by factors such as age and tissue location. This knowledge gap stems from the lack of comprehensive databases and tools to decipher the differentiation process. In this study, we introduce TrajAtlas, a comprehensive framework designed to bridge this gap. To explore the cellular origins of osteoblasts, we constructed an atlas centered on osteogenesis. To answer how progenitor cells differentiate to osteoblasts, we developed a model that reveals the dynamic regulatory landscape during this process. To elucidate the influence of age and tissue location on differentiation, we built a tool for differential analysis. Furthermore, to identify conserved patterns of differentiation, we developed an approach to detect pseudotemporal gene modules. We validated the effectiveness of this framework by applying it to more datasets, unveiling novel cell states associated with injury. Notably, this framework focuses on dynamic processes, with the potential for broader applications in studying cell differentiation and complementing cell-centric analyses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, the mechanisms underlying osteoblast differentiation from these multiple osteoprogenitors remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a comprehensive framework to investigate osteoblast differentiation at multiple scales, encompassing cells, genes, and gene modules. We constructed a reference atlas focused on differentiation, which incorporates various osteoprogenitors and provides a seven-level cellular taxonomy. To reconstruct the differentiation process, we developed a model that identifies the transcription factors and pathways involved in differentiation from different osteoprogenitors. Acknowledging that covariates such as age and tissue type can influence differentiation, we created an algorithm to detect differentially expressed genes throughout the differentiation process. Additionally, we implemented methods to identify conserved pseudotemporal gene modules across multiple samples. Overall, our framework systematically addresses the heterogeneity observed during osteoblast differentiation from diverse sources, offering novel insights into the complexities of bone formation and serving as a valuable resource for understanding osteogenesis.},

Thus, joint analysis of atlas datasets requires reliable data integration. To guide integration method choice, we benchmarked 68 method and preprocessing combinations on 85 batches of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and simulation data from 23 publications, altogether representing {$>$}1.2 million cells distributed in 13 atlas-level integration tasks. We evaluated methods according to scalability, usability and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation using 14 evaluation metrics. We show that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, scANVI, Scanorama, scVI and scGen perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks, while single-cell ATAC-sequencing integration performance is strongly affected by choice of feature space.

Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.},

We validate HypoMap by comparing data collected from Smart-Seq+Fluidigm C1 and bulk RNA sequencing of selected neuronal cell types with different degrees of cellular heterogeneity. Finally, via HypoMap, we identify classes of neurons expressing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Glp1r) and prepronociceptin (Pnoc), and validate them using single-molecule in situ hybridization. Collectively, HypoMap provides a unified framework for the systematic functional annotation of murine hypothalamic cell types, and it can serve as an important platform to unravel the functional organization of hypothalamic neurocircuits and to identify druggable targets for treating metabolic disorders.},

  abstract = {A wealth of clustering algorithms are available for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to enable the identification of functionally distinct subpopulations that each possess a different pattern of gene expression activity. Implementation of these methods requires a choice of resolution parameter to determine the number of clusters, and critical judgment from the researchers is required to determine the desired resolution. This supervised process takes significant time and effort. Moreover, it can be difficult to compare and characterize the evolution of cell clusters from results obtained at one single resolution. To overcome these challenges, we built Multi-resolution Reconciled Tree (MRtree), a highly flexible tree-construction algorithm that generates a cluster hierarchy from flat clustering results attained for a range of resolutions. Because MRtree can be coupled with most scRNA-seq clustering algorithms, it inherits the robustness and versatility of a flat clustering approach, while maintaining the hierarchical structure of cells. The constructed trees from multiple scRNA-seq datasets effectively reflect the extent of transcriptional distinctions among cell groups and align well with levels of functional specializations among cells. Importantly, application to fetal brain cells identified subtypes of cells determined mainly by maturation states, spatial location and terminal specification.},

  abstract = {Background Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has contributed significantly to diverse research areas in biology, from cancer to development. Since scRNA-seq data is high-dimensional, a common strategy is to learn low-dimensional latent representations better to understand overall structure in the data. In this work, we build upon scVI, a powerful deep generative model which can learn biologically meaningful latent representations, but which has limited explicit control of batch effects. Rather than prioritizing batch effect removal over conservation of biological variation, or vice versa, our goal is to provide a bird's eye view of the trade-offs between these two conflicting objectives. Specifically, using the well established concept of Pareto front from economics and engineering, we seek to learn the entire trade-off curve between conservation of biological variation and removal of batch effects. Results A multi-objective optimisation technique known as Pareto multi-task learning (Pareto MTL) is used to obtain the Pareto front between conservation of biological variation and batch effect removal. Our results indicate Pareto MTL can obtain a better Pareto front than the naive scalarization approach typically encountered in the literature. In addition, we propose to measure batch effect by applying a neural-network based estimator called Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) and show benefits over the more standard maximum mean discrepancy measure. Conclusion The Pareto front between conservation of biological variation and batch effect removal is a valuable tool for researchers in computational biology. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of applying Pareto MTL to estimate the Pareto front in conjunction with applying MINE to measure the batch effect.},

  abstract = {The systematic classification of the cells that compose a tissue or an organ is key to understanding how these cells cooperate and interact as a functional unit. Our capacity to detect features that define cell identity has evolved from morphological and chemical analyses, through the use of predefined genetic markers, to unbiased transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling. The innovative technology of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables transcriptional profiling of thousands of individual cells. Since its development, scRNA-seq has been extensively applied to numerous organs and tissues in a wide range of animal models and human samples, thereby providing a plethora of fundamental biological insights into their development, homeostasis, and pathology. In this review, we present the findings of 3 recent studies that employed scRNA-seq to unravel the complexity of cellular composition in mammalian teeth. These findings offer an unprecedented catalogue of cell types in the mouse incisor, which is a convenient model system for studying continuous tooth growth. These studies identified novel cell types in the tooth epithelium and mesenchyme, as well as new markers for known cell types. Computational analyses of the data also uncovered the lineage and dynamics of cell states during ameloblast and odontoblast differentiation during both normal homeostasis and injury repair. The transcriptional differences between the mouse incisor and mouse and human molars uncover species-specific as well as shared features in tooth cell composition. Here, we highlight these findings and discuss important similarities and differences between these studies. We also discuss potential future applications of scRNA-seq in dental research and dentistry. Together, these studies demonstrate how the rapidly evolving technology of scRNA-seq can advance the study of tooth development and function and provide putative targets for regenerative approaches.},

  abstract = {Single-cell (sc) omics has become a powerful tool to unravel a tissue's cell landscape across health and disease. In recent years, sc transcriptomic interrogation has been applied to a variety of tooth tissues of both human and mouse, which has considerably advanced our fundamental understanding of tooth biology. Now, an overarching and integrated bird's-view of the human and mouse tooth sc transcriptomic landscape would be a powerful multi-faceted tool for dental research, enabling further decipherment of tooth biology and development through constantly progressing state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods as well as the exploration of novel hypothesis-driven research. To this aim, we re-assessed and integrated recently published scRNA-sequencing datasets of different dental tissue types (healthy and diseased) from human and mouse to establish inclusive tooth sc atlases, and applied the consolidated data map to explore its power. For mouse tooth, we identified novel candidate transcriptional regulators of the ameloblast lineage. Regarding human tooth, we provide support for a developmental connection, not advanced before, between specific epithelial compartments. Taken together, we established inclusive mouse and human tooth sc atlases as powerful tools to potentiate innovative research into tooth biology, development and disease. The maps are provided online in an accessible format for interactive exploration.},

  abstract = {Background The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in tooth morphogenesis have been the research focus in the fields of tooth and bone development. However, the cell population in molars at the late bell stage and the mechanisms of hard tissue formation and mineralization remain limited knowledge. Results Here, we used the rat mandibular first and second molars as models to perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to investigate cell identity and driver genes related to dental mesenchymal cell differentiation during the late bell hard tissue formation stage. We identified seven main cell types and investigated the heterogeneity of mesenchymal cells. Subsequently, we identified novel cell marker genes, including Pclo in dental follicle cells, Wnt10a in pre-odontoblasts, Fst and Igfbp2 in periodontal ligament cells, and validated the expression of Igfbp3 in the apical pulp. The dynamic model revealed three differentiation trajectories within mesenchymal cells, originating from two types of dental follicle cells and apical pulp cells. Apical pulp cell differentiation is associated with the genes Ptn and Satb2, while dental follicle cell differentiation is associated with the genes Tnc, Vim, Slc26a7, and Fgfr1. Cluster-specific regulons were analyzed by pySCENIC. In addition, the odontogenic function of driver gene TNC was verified in the odontoblastic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells. The expression of osteoclast differentiation factors was found to be increased in macrophages of the mandibular first molar. Conclusions Our results revealed the cell heterogeneity of molars in the late bell stage and identified driver genes associated with dental mesenchymal cell differentiation. These findings provide potential targets for diagnosing dental hard tissue diseases and tooth regeneration.},

  abstract = {Endothelial cells (ECs) and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) play crucial roles in supporting hematopoiesis and hematopoietic regeneration. However, whether ECs are a source of BMSCs remains unclear. Here, we evaluate the contribution of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition to BMSC generation in postnatal mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies ECs expressing BMSC markers Prrx1 and Lepr; however, this could not be validated using Prrx1-Cre and Lepr-Cre transgenic mice. Additionally, only a minority of BMSCs are marked by EC lineage tracing models using Cdh5-rtTA-tetO-Cre or Tek-CreERT2. Moreover, Cdh5+ BMSCs and Tek+ BMSCs show distinct spatial distributions and characteristic mesenchymal markers, suggestive of their origination from different progenitors rather than CDH5+ TEK+ ECs. Furthermore, myeloablation induced by 5-fluorouracil treatment does not increase Cdh5+ BMSCs. Our findings indicate that ECs hardly convert to BMSCs during homeostasis and myeloablation-induced hematopoietic regeneration, highlighting the importance of using appropriate genetic models and conducting careful data interpretation in studies concerning endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.},

  abstract = {Epithelial--mesenchymal transition (EMT) encompasses dynamic changes in cellular organization from epithelial to mesenchymal phenotypes, which leads to functional changes in cell migration and invasion. EMT occurs in a diverse range of physiological and pathological conditions and is driven by a conserved set of inducing signals, transcriptional regulators and downstream effectors. With over 5,700 publications indexed by Web of Science in 2019 alone, research on EMT is expanding rapidly. This growing interest warrants the need for a consensus among researchers when referring to and undertaking research on EMT. This Consensus Statement, mediated by `the EMT International Association' (TEMTIA), is the outcome of a 2-year-long discussion among EMT researchers and aims to both clarify the nomenclature and provide definitions and guidelines for EMT research in future publications. We trust that these guidelines will help to reduce misunderstanding and misinterpretation of research data generated in various experimental models and to promote cross-disciplinary collaboration to identify and address key open questions in this research field. While recognizing the importance of maintaining diversity in experimental approaches and conceptual frameworks, we emphasize that lasting contributions of EMT research to increasing our understanding of developmental processes and combatting cancer and other diseases depend on the adoption of a unified terminology to describe EMT.},

  abstract = {Mutations in the liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase (Alpl) gene cause hypophosphatasia (HPP) and early-onset bone dysplasia, suggesting that this gene is a key factor in human bone development. However, how and where Alpl acts in bone ageing is largely unknown. Here, we determined that ablation of Alpl induces prototypical premature bone ageing characteristics, including bone mass loss and marrow fat gain coupled with elevated expression of p16INK4A (p16) and p53 due to senescence and impaired differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Mechanistically, Alpl deficiency in MSCs enhances ATP release and reduces ATP hydrolysis. Then, the excessive extracellular ATP is, in turn, internalized by MSCs and causes an elevation in the intracellular ATP level, which consequently inactivates the AMPK{$\alpha$} pathway and contributes to the cell fate switch of MSCs. Reactivating AMPK{$\alpha$} by metformin treatment successfully prevents premature bone ageing in Alpl+/- mice by improving the function of endogenous MSCs. These results identify a previously unknown role of Alpl in the regulation of ATP-mediated AMPK{$\alpha$} alterations that maintain MSC stemness and prevent bone ageing and show that metformin offers a potential therapeutic option.},

  abstract = {The periodontium is essential for supporting the functionality of the tooth, composed of diversity of mineralized and non-mineralized tissues such as the cementum, the periodontal ligament (PDL) and the alveolar bone. The periodontium is developmentally derived from the dental follicle (DF), a fibrous tissue surrounding the developing tooth bud. We previously showed through in vivo lineage-tracing experiments that DF contains mesenchymal progenitor cells expressing parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which give rise to cells forming the periodontal attachment apparatus in a manner regulated by autocrine signaling through the PTH/PTHrP receptor. However, the developmental relationships between PTHrP+ DF cells and diverse cell populations constituting the periodontium remain undefined. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of cells in the periodontium by integrating the two datasets, i.e. PTHrP-mCherry+ DF cells at P6 and 2.3kb Col1a1 promoter-driven GFP+ periodontal cells at P25 that include descendants of PTHrP+ DF cells, cementoblasts, osteoblasts and periodontal ligament cells. This integrative scRNA-seq analysis revealed heterogeneity of cells of the periodontium and their cell type-specific markers, as well as their relationships with DF cells. Most importantly, our analysis identified a cementoblast-specific metagene that discriminate cementoblasts from alveolar bone osteoblasts, including Pthlh (encoding PTHrP) and Tubb3. RNA velocity analysis indicated that cementoblasts were directly derived from PTHrP+ DF cells in the early developmental stage and did not interconvert with other cell types. Further, CellPhoneDB cell-cell communication analysis indicated that PTHrP derived from cementoblasts acts on diversity of cells in the periodontium in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the lineage hierarchy and intercellular interactions of cells in the periodontium at a single-cell level, aiding to understand cellular and molecular basis of periodontal tissue formation.},

Here, we generate a dual-fluorescence model to track and analyze dental cells from embryonic to postnatal stages, in which Pitx2+ epithelium and Msx1+ mesenchyme are sufficient for tooth reconstitution. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial mapping further revealed critical cellular dynamics during molar development, where tooth germs are organized by Msx1+Sdc1+ dental papilla and surrounding dental niche. Surprisingly, niche cells are more efficient in tooth reconstitution and can directly regenerate papilla cells through interaction with dental epithelium. Finally, from the dental niche, we identify a group of previously unappreciated migratory Msx1+ Sox9+ cells as the potential cell origin for dental papilla. Our results indicate that the dental niche cells directly contribute to tooth organogenesis and provide critical insights into the essential cell composition for tooth engineering.},
