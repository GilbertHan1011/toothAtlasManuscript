  abstract = {Cranial neural crest cells are an evolutionary innovation of vertebrates for craniofacial development and function, yet the mechanisms that govern the cell fate decisions of postmigratory cranial neural crest cells remain largely unknown. Using the mouse molar as a model, we perform single-cell transcriptome profiling to interrogate the cell fate diversification of postmigratory cranial neural crest cells. We reveal the landscape of transcriptional heterogeneity and define the specific cellular domains during the progression of cranial neural crest cell-derived dental lineage diversification, and find that each domain makes a specific contribution to distinct molar mesenchymal tissues. Furthermore, IGF signaling-mediated cell-cell interaction between the cellular domains highlights the pivotal role of autonomous regulation of the dental mesenchyme. Importantly, we reveal cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks in the dental mesenchyme and show that Foxp4 is indispensable for the differentiation of periodontal ligament. Our single-cell atlas provides comprehensive mechanistic insight into the cell fate diversification process of the cranial neural crest cell-derived odontogenic populations.},

  abstract = {Osteoblasts are the only cells that can give rise to bones in vertebrates. Thus, one of the most important functions of these metabolically active cells is mineralized matrix production. Because osteoblasts have a limited lifespan, they must be constantly replenished by preosteoblasts, their immediate precursors. Because disruption of the regulation of bone-forming osteoblasts results in a variety of bone diseases, a better understanding of the origin of these cells by defining the mechanisms of bone development, remodeling, and regeneration is central to the development of novel therapeutic approaches. In recent years, substantial new insights into the origin of osteoblasts---largely owing to rapid technological advances in murine lineage-tracing approaches and other single-cell technologies---have been obtained. Collectively, these findings indicate that osteoblasts involved in bone formation under various physiological, pathological, and therapeutic conditions can be obtained from numerous sources. The origins of osteoblasts include, but are not limited to, chondrocytes in the growth plate, stromal cells in the bone marrow, quiescent bone-lining cells on the bone surface, and specialized fibroblasts in the craniofacial structures, such as sutures and periodontal ligaments. Because osteoblasts can be generated from local cellular sources, bones can flexibly respond to regenerative and anabolic cues. However, whether osteoblasts derived from different cellular sources have distinct functions remains to be investigated. Currently, we are at the initial stage to aptly unravel the incredible diversity of the origins of bone-forming osteoblasts. {\copyright} 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).},

However, the division of labor and hierarchical relationship between different progenitor populations remain undetermined. Here we developed dual-recombinase fate-mapping systems to capture the skeletal progenitor transition during postnatal bone formation. We showed that postnatal osteoblasts arose primarily from chondrocytes before adolescence and from Lepr+ bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) after adolescence. This transition occurred in the diaphysis during adolescence and progressively spread to the metaphysis. The osteoblast-forming Lepr+ BMSCs derived primarily from fetal Col2+ cells. Conditional deletion of Runx2 from perinatal chondrocytes and adult Lepr+ BMSCs impaired bone lengthening and thickening, respectively. Forced running increased osteoblast formation by perinatal chondrocytes but not by adult Lepr+ BMSCs. Thus, the short-term developmental skeletal progenitors generated the long-term adult skeletal progenitors. They sequentially control the growth and maintenance of endochondral bones.},

Through in vivo lineage tracing, we demonstrated the power of this approach by showing that co-expression module members Lrig1 and Igfbp5 define populations of incisor epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells. We further discovered that two adjacent mesenchymal tissues, the periodontium and dental pulp, are maintained by distinct pools of stem cells. These findings reveal novel mechanisms of incisor renewal and illustrate how gene co-expression analysis of intact biological systems can provide insights into the transcriptional basis of cellular identity.},

Therefore, we investigated cellular composition of growing and non-growing mouse and human teeth. As a result, we report an unappreciated cellular complexity of the continuously-growing mouse incisor, which suggests a coherent model of cell dynamics enabling unarrested growth. This model relies on spatially-restricted stem, progenitor and differentiated populations in the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments underlying the coordinated expansion of two major branches of pulpal cells and diverse epithelial subtypes. Further comparisons of human and mouse teeth yield both parallelisms and differences in tissue heterogeneity and highlight the specifics behind growing and non-growing modes. Despite being similar at a coarse level, mouse and human teeth reveal molecular differences and species-specific cell subtypes suggesting possible evolutionary divergence. Overall, here we provide an atlas of human and mouse teeth with a focus on growth and differentiation.},

  abstract = {Tooth development is a complex process orchestrated by intricate gene regulatory networks, involving both odontogenic epithelium and ectomesenchyme. Six1, a pivotal transcription factor (TF), is involved in the development of the lower incisor. However, its precise role during incisor development and the molecular mechanisms underpinning its regulatory functions remain poorly understood. This study employs Six1 deletion mouse models to elucidate the critical regulatory role of Six1 in governing dental mesenchyme development. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing, we constructed a comprehensive transcriptome atlas of tooth germ development from the bud to bell stage. Our analyses suggest that the dental follicle and the dental papilla (DP) are differentiated from dental ectomesenchyme (DEM) and identify the key TFs underlying these distinct states. Notably, we show that Dlx1, Dlx2, and Dlx5 (Dlx1/2/5) may function as the key TFs that promote the formation of DP. We further show that the deletion of Six1 perturbs dental mesenchyme development by impeding the transitions from DEM to DP states. Importantly, SIX1 directly binds to the promoters of Dlx1/2/5 to promote their co-expression, which subsequently leads to widespread epigenetic and transcriptional remodeling. In summary, our findings unveil Six1's indispensable role in incisor development, offering key insights into TF-driven regulatory networks that govern dental mesenchyme cell fate transitions during tooth development.},

To date, it has remained elusive whether there are certain differences in the dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) from donors of different ages. In the present study, DPSC lines were derived using teeth from children, adolescents, adults and aged donors. The derivation efficiency, the proliferative and apoptotic rate, cell marker expression and the differentiation capacity were investigated and compared among these DPSC lines. The derivation efficacy was decreased with increasing donor age. Although a large part of cell surface markers was expressed in all DPSC lines, the expression of CD29 was downregulated in the DPSCs from aged teeth. In addition, the doubling time of DPSCs from aged teeth was prolonged and the number of apoptotic cells was increased with the propagation. These DPSCs were able to differentiate into a neuronal linage, which positively expressed the neuron-specific class~III beta-tubulin and microtubule-associated protein~2, as well as into an osteogenic lineage, which positively expressed CD45; however, these DPSCs from aged teeth were completely or partially deprived of differentiation capacity. By contrast, DPSCs from younger teeth displayed significantly higher vitality and a higher potential for use in dental regenerative medicine.},

The HLCA presents a consensus cell type re-annotation with matching marker genes, including annotations of rare and previously undescribed cell types. Leveraging the number and diversity of individuals in the HLCA, we identify gene modules that are associated with demographic covariates such as age, sex and body mass index, as well as gene modules changing expression along the proximal-to-distal axis of the bronchial tree. Mapping new data to the HLCA enables rapid data annotation and interpretation. Using the HLCA as a reference for the study of disease, we identify shared cell states across multiple lung diseases, including SPP1+ profibrotic monocyte-derived macrophages in COVID-19, pulmonary fibrosis and lung carcinoma. Overall, the HLCA serves as an example for the development and use of large-scale, cross-dataset organ atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.},
