    abstract = {Osteoblasts, the key cells responsible for bone formation and the maintenance of skeletal integrity, originate from a diverse array of progenitor cells. However, the mechanisms underlying osteoblast differentiation from these multiple osteoprogenitors remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a comprehensive framework to investigate osteoblast differentiation at multiple scales, encompassing cells, genes, and gene modules. We constructed a reference atlas focused on differentiation, which incorporates various osteoprogenitors and provides a seven-level cellular taxonomy. To reconstruct the differentiation process, we developed a model that identifies the transcription factors and pathways involved in differentiation from different osteoprogenitors. Acknowledging that covariates such as age and tissue type can influence differentiation, we created an algorithm to detect differentially expressed genes throughout the differentiation process. Additionally, we implemented methods to identify conserved pseudotemporal gene modules across multiple samples. Overall, our framework systematically addresses the heterogeneity observed during osteoblast differentiation from diverse sources, offering novel insights into the complexities of bone formation and serving as a valuable resource for understanding osteogenesis.},
