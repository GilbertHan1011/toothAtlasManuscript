Annotation
===============================

In this section, we will adapt the annotation pipeline from `scHarmonization <https://github.com/lsteuernagel/scHarmonization/>`_ :cite:p:`steuernagelHypoMapUnifiedSinglecell2022` to our data.
You can just run this pipeline directly. Here, I just break down the pipeline into several steps for better understanding.
