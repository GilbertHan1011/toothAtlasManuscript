## Outer enamel epithelium
This cluster is annotated base on the study described in {cite:p}`krivanekDentalCellType2020b`.

## Inner enamel epithelium
Based on the marker *Sfrp5*, *Cldn10* {cite:p}`hermansEstablishmentInclusiveSinglecell2022`, we annotate this cluster as inner enamel epithelium.

## Stratum intermedium
Stratum intermedium markers (*Thbd*, *Jph4*) {cite:p}`krivanekDentalCellType2020b` are expressed in this cluster.

## Early ameloblast
We found a cluster specificly expressed mineralization marker *Dspp*, align with the study {cite:p}`chibaSingleCellRNASequencingMouse2020a`. Base on it's relationship with pre-ameloblast and secretory ameloblast, we annotate it as early ameloblast.
